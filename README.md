# Prolog
This repository contains the work of 3 semesters. 3 different subjects, all in prolog.

Things you may want to know:
- The folder of Logical Programming contains my first attempts using Prolog, so there may be some **minor** mistakes.
- The folder of Artificial Intelligence contains a folder named Ergasia4 which contains a file named Ergasia4.pl. This file is **not** broken! It contains Greek characters, that's why it appears strange. It needs special configuration in your editor to be readable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't understand Greek then, sorry...it will all be Greek to you (**heheðŸ¥²**). Okay, maybe not all, but the comments in the code and the pdf files are in Greek.
